The StageShow plugin adds an online Box-Office for websites of Small Theatres and Amateur Drama Groups.

== Description ==

One or more performances can be defined, each with a specified start date/time, maximum number of places, ticket types and prices. 

A [sshow-boxoffice] tag added to a Page on the website adds the Box Office entry to the site.

StageShow uses the PayPal API to interface to PayPal to create "Saved Buttons" which are used to collect ticket payments and to control the maximum number of tickets sold for each performance. PayPal IPN (Instant Payment Notification) is used to verify payments and to collect buyer information. 

Each sale is fully recorded, with contact and payment details, and the seats purchased. Confirmation emails, which can be customised as required, are sent to each purchaser and copied to the system administrator.

StageShow includes the facility to export both settings and sales to a "TAB Separated Text" file for further analysis or processing by other programs (i.e. Spreadsheets etc.).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I set up StageShow? =

* Install the plugin and activate it
* Go to the StageShow - Settings page and enter your PayPal details and click "Save Settings"
* Now go to the show, performance and prices pages and set up your show!
* Create a page on your website for the Box Office (or edit an existing one) and add the tag [sshow-boxoffice] to it
		
= What PayPal settings are required? =

PayPal API Access must be enabled - and the associated User, Password and Signature entries added to "Stageshow" settings. The PayPal API EMail for the live PayPal site will be read from PayPal server when settings are saved. API EMail for the PayPal Sandbox site cannot be determined programatically, and must be entered on the settings page.
		
IPN Notification must be enabled for Sales to be recorded by the PlugIn. Payment will still be accepted and the sale will be recorded by PayPal if IPN is disabled.
	
= Why can't I edit the PayPal settings? =

PayPal Login details cannot be changed if one or more performance entries are present. 

The StageShow plugin creates a PayPal "Saved Button" when a performance is added to the show. There is currently no mechanism to recreate these buttons if the PayPal configuration is changed, hence the limitation.

= What WordPress settings are required? =

StageShow needs the WordPress setting of TimeZone to be correctly set-up (i.e. to a City) for time-sensitive functionality to operate correctly. The current value can be found on the Settings->General admin page.
	
= Why can't I delete a show or performances? =

A performance cannot be deleted if there are sales recorded for it and the show start time has not yet been reached. A show cannot be deleted if performances are still configured for it.

= How do I add a Booking Form to my site? =

Add the tag [sshow-boxoffice] to either a new or existing page on your site. This will be replaced by the booking form when the page is viewed by a user.

= How can I customise the EMails? =

The EMails generated by the StageShow plugin are defined by a template file. By default the template file is {Plugins Folder}/stageshow/templates/stageshow_EMail.php

The template file can be modified as required. A number of "Tags" can be included in the EMail template, which will be replaced by data relating to the sale extracted from the database. 

= What tags can be used in the EMail template? =

The following tags can be used in the EMail template:

* [salePPName]	Buyer PayPal Account Details: Name
* [salePPStreet]	Buyer PayPal Account Details: Street
* [salePPCity]	Buyer PayPal Account Details: City
